As one of the creators of "Scelerosus Urba" I want to have an in-game reflection of myself.

The NPC called "Lucas Statuarius" is the leader and secretary of the guild called "______".
He is responsible for selling premuim currency called "Diamond Coins" which is based on one gram of diamond unit.
He delegates quests, grants daily gifts for players, shares stories of his life when you get another level of acquaintance with him
and he gives you necessary tutorial when you ask him by choosing an intereaction button for "get to know how to play the game".
