As one of the creators of "Scelerosus Urba" I want to have an in-game reflection of myself.

1. The role: Lucas Statuarius is the NPC who is a secretary and the Prime President of the "Alatheia Guild"
             He is in charge of the information circulating and networking and additionally he is also guiding
             newbies if you ask him for in-game tutorial. He will then give you a book which contains all
             necessary things for a newbie to know and that book would be added in options bar titled:
             "Alatheia Encyclopedia" where the player can get to know about the gameplay, classes, equipment,
             city description, strongholds exploration, events, associaships and so on. If you ask him to convert
             into the human class, to get to know or understand the lore fragments scattered around while exploring
             or to register a guild from establised band as a band leader you can call him easily.

2. How does he look: He is a 25 years old male who is 177 cm tall, he is slightly muscular, his skin is slightly tanned
                     but has a white carnation nonetheless. His beard is shaved and profiled in a way that he has it on
                     the edge of mandible, connected to his top head hair and a mustache. His hairdo is short in the style
