As one of the creators of "Scelerosus Urba" I want to have an in-game reflection of myself.

1. The role: Lucas Statuarius is the NPC who is a secretary and the Prime President of the "Alatheia Guild"
             He is in charge of the information circulating and networking and additionally he is also guiding
             newbies if you ask him for in-game tutorial. He will then give you a book which contains all
             necessary things for a newbie to know and that book would be added in options bar titled:
             "Alatheia Encyclopedia" where the player can get to know about the gameplay, classes, equipment,
             city description, strongholds exploration, events, associaships and so on. If you ask him to convert
             into the human class, to get to know or understand the lore fragments scattered around while exploring
             or to register a guild from establised band as a band leader you can call him easily.

2. How does he look: He is a 25 years old male who is 177 cm tall, he is slightly muscular, his skin is slightly tanned
                     but has a white carnation nonetheless. His beard is shaved and profiled in a way that he has it on
                     the edge of mandible, connected to his top head hair and a mustache. His hairdo is short, in the style
                     popular in the 30's XXth century. His eyes color is in both eyes a mix of gray and blue and the color
                     of his hair on both beard and hairdo is dark brown. His facial features are serious, sharp and intelligent.
                     He wears always elegant double-breasted navy-black blazer on top of the white collared shirt with
                     a red tie and according to the blazer's color narrow trousers. He has no tattoes, no implants and
                     no robotic parts. He wears prescription glasses and a marriage ring on his right ring finger.
                     His looks make others feel respectful to him and encouraged to wear similar clothing.

3. His character: He is looking cold but actually he is kind to others and always willing to help if it's alright.
                  The elegant and modest looks complement his gentleman behavior and his sarmatian attitude. Most
                  of the time he is calm but when it goes to the topic of hordes, enterprises, government and masonry
                  he becomes eager to even argue and provide proofs of his statements that it's all a conspiracy
                  and it is a plan of the satan to make people damn themselves and to be unable to go the way
                  his Lord provides. However he is prudent enough to recognize the ignorant and cut off the topic if
                  it's useless. When it comes to the practical tasks he can be clumsy because he likes to distract 
                  himself with thoughtfullness while working. By outsiders misunderstood, for his fellows unpredictable.
                  Known for his in-depth and wide range of knowledge in economy, history, philosophy, theology, aphology
                  and sociology is a very prominent person which presence might drastically change other's views if open
                  for new perspectives people yearn for the truth and meet him. His far-end goal mind and holistic vision
                  makes him an exceptional leader and friend who's words might save your life and even soul.

4. Relationship: He is married to the female doctor and surgeon called Marie Statuarius. Their relationship
                 is stable, without heavily emotional outbursts. If they meet crisis or if someone has a problem
                 they help each other through encouragement, opinion, trust, sharing burdens and constant love.
                 Their love is silent, without sugarcoating so that people might look at them as acquaintances
                 or business partners, however that's their way to hide their intimate matter without unnecessary
                 exagerration to make it secret and hide it no matter what. That's why people see their marriage as 
                 a mature, well cared and understanding which is shocking to see considering their age and times (since
                 the society was rotten to the point of seeking pleasure, gossips, unpredictable affairs and denaturation).
                 This example is the point which people lawlessly criticize and insult that way of living. That's the
                 reason why He is only seen publicly and he hides her from unnecessary trouble, which actually makes their
                 relationship deeper and purer and she actually loves that in him. The protective attitude of his makes her
                 touched and relieved because he can even fight and get rid of their oppressors if that's vital for their
                 living and ensuring safety of their household. That way she is able to bear and raise children.
