1. The Scelerosus Urba's population is the mix of systematic organizations, fellowships and loose societies that have various goals and relations
   bewteen each other. There are:

   - Civilians - which are the poorest out of the societies who are often bullied or even killed by hordes and enterprises which are connected to
                 the masonry and local government, they sometimes are also bullied by loose bands of minor villains. They are needy, lost, often
                 scammed and confused by the propaganda which in turn makes them fight each other over themselves for nothing important.

   - Bands - they are loose fellowships which do various things like raiding horde's hideouts, robbing enterprises or even guilds and civilians.
             They care about each other and have some code but they aren't educated enough to understand the dignity of the people around them
             and how truly love works. They are opportunists who want to survive and live well enough.

   - Hordes - those live for mugging and killing civilians and bands, especially guilds are for them a tasty feast. They also are taking tags put
              by the organization called "Igne Infernum" which gives bounties on the people who are their nuissance and in reality this
              organization is a department of the "MammonCorp"
