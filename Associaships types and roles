1. The Scelerosus Urba's population is the mix of systematic organizations, fellowships and loose societies that have various goals and relations
   bewteen each other. There are:

   - Civilians - which are the poorest out of the societies who are often bullied or even killed by hordes and enterprises which are connected to
                 the masonry and local government, they sometimes are also bullied by loose bands of minor villains. They are needy, lost, often
                 scammed and confused by the propaganda which in turn makes them fight each other over themselves for nothing important.

   - Bands - they are loose fellowships which do various things like raiding horde's hideouts, robbing enterprises or even guilds and civilians.
             They care about each other and have some code but they aren't educated enough to understand the dignity of the people around them
             and how truly love works. They are opportunists who want to survive and live well enough.

   - Hordes - those live for mugging and killing civilians and bands, especially guilds are for them a tasty feast. They also are taking tags put
              by the organization called "Igne Infernum" which gives bounties on the people who are their nuissance and in reality this
              organization is a department of the "MammonCorp" which works as an silencer for the true rebells against the status quo. They also
              use the services of enterprises in casinos and clubs to have some fun and they buy necessary items they deem deadly and useful.
              their money and resources don't matter at all and they often find themselves broke but their evil deeds quickly recover this loss
              to continue their ecstatic and colorful life until they die.

   - Enterprises - the very strict for its employees organization within the jurisdiction of the "MammonCorp". They work to produce useless
                   products or necessary but cheap and harmful ones and then exporting them to its occupied sectors where they rule over
                   the masses. They monopolyze every branch of the market and economy leaving civilians with no choice but to follow their
                   dictatorship while constantly being brainwashed and used as slaves which work for pennies. They inflict silent fear upon
                   everyone in range leading them to despair and isolation. They divide and rule upon them to gain the most.

   - Guilds - the out of the world and out of the system fellowships and organizations which is hated by every other faction due to their 
              questioning about the morality, beliefs and ways of thinking. They ironically are mostly harmed by the ignorant civilians
              which betray them even after those are being helped by one of the guilds but they often sell their wherabouts to "Igne Infernum"
              leaving them no other choice but to leave quickly with their stuff if possible and save their lives or go into the martyrdom
              as an act of bravery to move the hearts of others. The urban legend says that their source of courage is their connection with
              the Holy Catholic Church which ceased to exist decades ago but works currently in shadows giving people hope, knowledge, freedom,
              virtues, sacraments and everything possible to reach the salvation in the afterlife by the grace and in the name of The Lord.
