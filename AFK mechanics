 1. AFK tasks in both CCO and ALC have its flaws. The first one makes AFK tasks focused on the personal grind in-game which makes you gain not so many stuff
    while second is a nearly automatic system where you collect stuff after you wait for after you pick a task for empty AFK slots. Both of those seem to not
    be funny for players and rather it looks like a stagnant way to gain idly resources.

 2. Which caused me to think about not adding into Scelorosus-Urba mercenaries form ALC which makes this game's character's power dependent on those in combat
    making it easy for p2w players to reign over non-p2w players but instead to make saved civilians from ? point encounters replace the company for the player
    in AFK tasks support. This way AFK tasks mechanic will change completely in terms of doing such tasks and delegating it on others.

 3. At first the player can only do 1 AFK task and this would be himself to do all the labor. Such a personal space for AFK tasks would be justified by
    the thought that player does actually do the work, in which he is busy. Soon enough if he has enough living space in the apartment he will be
    housing survivors and providing for them food, bathing, etc. That will increase passive costs that will be made when apartment fee is paid but the player
    will have a subordinating companions which will gladly work for you because they are mostly homeless, forsaken, poor, lost and hopeless people that
    without you will surely meet their doom. Therefore you have to keep your money supply constant and enough to ensure their safety. If you will leave the
    game later on without good enough money to pay rent and weekly costs for their living you will lose them all forever.

 4. Delegating jobs and doing them by yourself cost 4 exhaustion, cyberpsychosis points per task so if you as a human have low stamina it is better to focus
    solely on AFK tasks than doing raids. Even if you do nothing and just delegate jobs for others. Cyberpunks don't have to worry about anything because they
    use neuro stabilizers and the exhaustion they have had after delegating the job upon others is gone (they are addicted to stabilizers so they aren't here
    bothered by anything).

 5. The survivors will also grant you trust points, which is acquired in two ways. If you house survivors then after paid bills you will get 5 trust points
    per housed survivor. Another way is to get bonus trust points increase when you encounter additional survivor and successfully save him/her from trouble
    in stronghold while you don't have space for housing another companion. You can then replace the companion by the one you have saved (for looks if you
    like having better ones if possible) and after paying a good sum of money to make them last for a while no matter if you replace someone or not you will
    get another trust points batch (3 companions * 5 trust points gain = 15 trust points)

 6. You might be wondering why you get those in the first place? Well. Those points are used for personal growth of an individual companion buying the ability
    point which cost gradually grows. You will then choose 3 options: Either tasks delegating max capacity by 1 (base is 12 tasks), single task finishing time
    reduction by 1 minute (base is 25 minutes) or trust points gain increase by 1 (base gain per individual is 5). Maximum stats for a companion would be:
    max tasks delegation capacity: 24, single task time to finish: 15 min, trust points gain: 15.

 7. You as a player will get jobs knowledge exp no matter if you do the task by yourself or others do the work since as you live with them they 
    share you their job knowledge exp in count of 2 exp per task completed and if you do that by yourself you gain 6 exp per task completed. 
    Job knowledge lvl up makes you have additional attribute stats which would increase for you attribute points equal to that level and it can't go 
    higher than your level. If your class is a human you can additionally pay in in the Alatheia Guild's College for courses to gain the attributes 
    bonuses that come solely from those job attributes bonus. 

 8. That all above is in effect for both humans and cyberpunks equally. However from this point forward I will divide the AFK mechanic for humans and
    cyberpunks.

 9. Cyberpunks do personally tasks within 20 minutes, no more and no less, that's because of both their improved body functions by reconstructing their
    body to have no need to eat, drink, excrete, rest and so on. However that made them robotic and they have to do that thing slightly slower because they 
    have lost their natural instincts and habits which is humans advantage point. At once they can do 15 tasks at maximum because that's written within the
    installed into an implant protocols which explain the need to make every cyberpunk have a break to rewire and cool down the processors.

10. Humans although they have very slow pace at the beginning when they lack proficiency in working practices they are eager to learn. Their natural bodies
    made by the image of The Lord (according to the Lucas's commentary) are capable of exalting above cyberpunks dramatically when they will put hard work
    and focus. There is also a certain limit to their growth which can be broken by some teachings of a certain monk however this demands getting away from
    the city and taking a long walk to the place that has no roads to drive through and to get there you have to go through a dense forest which is the 
    reason why that monk is living there. Back to the topic. Humans at first are able to do at max 10 tasks within 25 minutes period but as they complete
    a certain amount of tasks they get into another level of proficiency. This makes them get 1 proficiency point which in turn makes them choose between
    the discipline trait proficiency (expanding tasks cap. by 1 up to 24) and time management proficiency (reducing by 1 min task finishing period to 15 min).
