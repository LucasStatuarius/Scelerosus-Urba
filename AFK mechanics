1. AFK tasks in both CCO and ALC have its flaws. The first one makes AFK tasks focused on the personal grind in-game which makes you gain not so many stuff
   while second is a nearly automatic system where you collect stuff after you wait for after you pick a task for empty AFK slots. Both of those seem to not
   be funny for players and rather it looks like a stagnant way to gain idly resources.

2. Which caused me to think about not adding into Scelorosus-Urba mercenaries form ALC which makes this game's character's power dependent on those in combat
   making it easy for p2w players to reign over non-p2w players but instead to make saved civilians from ? point encounters replace the company for the player
   in AFK tasks support. This way AFK tasks mechanic will change completely in terms of doing such tasks and delegating it on others.

3. At first the player can only do 1 AFK task and this would be himself to do all the labor. Such a personal space for AFK tasks would be justified by
   the thought that player does actually do the work, in which he is busy. Soon enough if he has enough living space in the apartment he will be
   housing survivors and providing for them food, bathing, etc. That will increase passive costs that will be made when apartment fee is paid but the player
   will have a subordinating companions which will gladly work for you because they are mostly homeless, forsaken, poor, lost and hopeless people that
   without you will surely meet their doom. Therefore you have to keep your money supply constant and enough to ensure their safety. If you will leave the
   game later on without good enough money to pay rent and weekly costs for their living you will lose them all forever.

4. The survivors will also grant you trust points, which is acquired in two ways. If you house survivors then after paid bills you will get 5 trust points
   per housed survivor. Another way is to get bonus trust points increase when you encounter additional survivor and successfully save him/her from trouble
   in stronghold while you don't have space for housing another companion. You can then replace the companion by the one you have saved (for looks if you
   like having better ones if possible) and after paying a good sum of money to make them last for a while no matter if you replace someone or not you will
   get another trust points batch.

5. You might be wondering why you get those in the first place? Well
