-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Statistics to the combat are:

Defensive stats:
1. Health, which represents a body state of the player
2. Armor, which represents a protective functionality of the equipment
(Armor replaces the shield stat from the ALC)
3. Endurance, which represents the raw damage absorbtion from enemy's damage
(Endurance replaces the Armor stat from the ALC)
4. Block rate and severity (it's common in RPG's)

Offensive stats:
1. Damage (I don't need to explain)
2. Critical rate and severity (same)

Attribute stats:
1. Strength, which improves physical damage and physical resistance
2. Vitality, which improves health and endurance 
3. Dexterity, which improves kinetic damage and kinetic resistance
4. Intelligence, which improves energy damage and energy resistance

Equipment and its properties:
1. Weapon - no matter the class every player is equipped with one weapon of its respective types:
   - Blade, which deals physical damage (base damage is combined with physical damage)
   - Gun, which deals kinetic damage    (in every weapon damage stat is a base one)
   - Drone, which deals energy damage   (attribute damage there would be shown as well as its equation from which it comes)
2. Clothing - there are 4 clothing parts which are equipped no matter the class:
   - Upper clothing - has health armor and endurance stats as a base
   - Lower clothing - same base stats as for upper clothing
   - Boots - same
   - Headgear - same              4        4             8              12
+ proportion of stats quantity: Boots = Headgear < Lower clothing < Upper clothing
3. Accessories (for all)
   - 2 rings - has 2 random attribute stats as base stats
   - necklace - has 3 random attribute stats as base stats
4. Exclusive for cyberpunks:
   - 2 Implants which have 6 in scale of health, armor and endurance + 1 random attribute stat
5. Equipment's tiers:
   - trash - (8 health + 4 armor + 0,5 endurance) Ã— proportion scale of the equipment part
   - common - (12 H + 6 A + 1 E)
   - unusual - (18 H + 9 A + 1,5 E)
   - unique - (25 H + 12 A + 2 E)
   - special - (36 H + 18 A + 4 E)
   - treasure - (49 H + 24 A + 8 E)
6. Equipment leveling up:
   lvl 1: proportion scale for its equipment + 1 (for example for upper clothing: 12+1=13)
   lvl 2: proportion scale for its equipment + 2 (12+2=14)
   And so on and so forth
7. Attributes traits in equipment:
   Each 5th level after the 1st level is added 1 more attribute stat
   so that when at 5th level it has been 1str then at 6th will be 2str and so on.
8. 
9. Equipment enhancement:
   Each equipment can be upgraded via enhancement process but there's a risk of destroying the equipment in the process.
   Enhancing can be commenced via enhancement sets which are used for improving the stats of a certain equipment:
   +1 
   +2
   +3
   +4
