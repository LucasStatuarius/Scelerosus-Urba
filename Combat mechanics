-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Statistics to the combat are:

Defensive stats:
1. Health, which represents a body state of the player
2. Armor, which represents a protective functionality of the equipment
(Armor replaces the shield stat from the ALC)
3. Endurance, which represents the raw damage absorbtion from enemy's damage
(Endurance replaces the Armor stat from the ALC)
4. Block rate and severity (it's common in RPG's)
5. Evasion rate: fixed probability of 4% to evade enemies attacks

Offensive stats:
1. Damage (I don't need to explain)
2. Critical rate and severity (same)

Attribute stats:
1. Strength, which improves physical damage and physical resistance
2. Vitality, which improves health and endurance 
3. Dexterity, which improves kinetic damage and kinetic resistance
4. Intelligence, which improves energy damage and energy resistance

     In effect each attribute stat except for vitality has doubled count of resistance for its respective trait
     and quadripled count of its attribute damage for each point of dexterity, strengh and intelligence.           (comb. attr. mult. with prprty)
     If someone fights unarmed then attribute damages combine together  (for begginer without any equipment it's 12 damage from 3*4=12)
     As for the vitality it would give a player 100 health and 1 endurance. (beginner absorbs 3 dmg for each type via 2 of res. + 1 end.)

Equipment and its properties:
  1. Weapon - no matter the class every player is equipped with one weapon of its respective types:
   - Blade, which deals physical damage (base damage is combined with physical damage)
   - Gun, which deals kinetic damage    (in every weapon damage stat is a base one)
   - Drone, which deals energy damage   (attribute damage there would be shown as well as its equation from which it comes)
  2. Clothing - there are 4 clothing parts which are equipped no matter the class:
   - Upper clothing - has health armor and endurance stats as a base
   - Lower clothing - same base stats as for upper clothing
   - Boots - same
   - Headgear - same                4         4             6              8
  + proportion of stats quantity: Boots = Headgear < Lower clothing < Upper clothing
  3. Accessories (for all)
     - 2 rings - has 1 random attribute stats as base stats
     - necklace - has 2 random attribute stats as base stats
  4. Exclusive for cyberpunks:
     - 2 Implants which have 5 in scale of health, armor and endurance + 1 random attribute stat respective to the level
  5. Equipment's tiers:
     - trash - (8 health + 4 armor + 1 endurance) Ã— proportion scale of the equipment part
     - common - (12 H + 6 A + 2 E)
     - rare - (18 H + 9 A + 3 E)
     - unique - (22 H + 11 A + 4 E)
     - special - (30 H + 15 A + 6 E)
     - treasure - (40 H + 20 A + 8 E)
  6. Equipment leveling up:
     lvl 1: proportion scale for its equipment + 1 (for example for upper clothing: 8+1=9)
     lvl 2: proportion scale for its equipment + 2 (8+2=10)
     And so on and so forth
  7. Attributes traits in equipment:
     If any equipment part has an attribute stat then it's counted like this:
     attribute count = (lvl of eq - 1) / 5 + 1
     for lvl 1 would be then for example only 1 str
     for lvl 6 would be 2 str
     for lvl 11 would be 3 str and so on and so forth
     attribute stats are immune to the tier-ups to balance the gameplay and to keep it simple
  8. Weapons:
     No matter the weapon type the damage stat is the same along its equal respective levels and tiers.
     The proportion of the weapon damage stat is 30 and every level it goes higher by one.
     Damage per each tier looks like this:
     - trash - proportion of the damage * 1
     - common - prop. of the dmg * 2
     - rare - prop. * 3
     - unique - prop. * 4
     - special - prop. * 5
     - treasure - prop. * 6
  9. Additional stats slots:
     For all of the equipment parts you can install additional stats depending on tiers like this:
     - trash - 0 (properties intaller from this tier doesn't exist)
     - common - 1
     - rare - 2
     - unique - 3
     - special - 4
     - treasure - 5
 10. Additional stats list:
     - block rate       - block severity
     - critical rate    - critical severity
     - intelligence     - dexterity
     - strengh          - vitality
     - health           - armor
 11. Additional stats varieties:
 12. Equipment enhancement:
     Each equipment can be upgraded via enhancement process but there's a risk of destroying the equipment in the process.
     Enhancing can be commenced via enhancement sets which are used for improving the stats of a certain equipment:
     +1 
     +2
     +3
     +4
