1. Classes in "Scelerosus Urba" work as a way to add a gameplay variety and its own values
   which have their own strenghs and weaknesses. It also can add some spice to the player's own
   experience giving a whole new perspective while doing stronghold runs, committing to do AFK tasks,
   fighting with other players and other stuff.

2. There are two classes which I have in my mind:
   - Humans - The humankind which became a minority of the Scelerosus Urba (around 45 percent) is by far the weakest
              group which major part became cyberpunks for career opportunities to survive. They do jobs slower
              than cyberpunks especially at the beginning of the job they are in. However their natural ability to train
              and learn makes them more proficient as they dedicate themselves for the activity they seem fit while
              overcoming gradually their weaknesses and actually making those their strengh.

   - Cyberpunks - Those are modified cybernetically humans which are far stronger than normal ones without physical
                  needs to rest as humans do however they are fast to reach cyberpsychosis which is the state of
                  mental breakdown via overuse of their cybernetic body which paralizes them if they will hit the
                  limit. They therefore are addicted to neuro stabilizers which are relieving them from that state.
                  They also are more proficient at using weapons, hacking and working idly via AFK tasks. Due to the
                  extreme changes of the body they can't multiply no matter the sex type but they benefit
                  from using replacable implants which enhance them even more.

3. How humankind works?:
   a) their limits:
      - They have a measure called Stamina which indicates their exhaustion from daily activities such as
        combat and work. In numbers they initially have 200 stamina meter and every 20 minutes human is
        recovering by 20 stamina. There is no item to make them recover faster.
      - They have also basic equipment slots for boots, legs clothing, torso clothing, headgear, 2 rings, pendant
        and weapon of their choice.
      - Since they have lower bodily capabilities for working they do one AFK task in 25 minutes period and they can do
        12 jobs at once which means they can work 5 hours at max.
      - In combat against cyberpunks they have no chance against them because of their weak bodies and no experience in it.

   b) their possibilities:
      - As they work longer and more frequently they gain proficiency experience when doing AFK tasks and fighting. When
        proficiency is full and then the proficiency level rises up by one there are 3 possible upgrades:
