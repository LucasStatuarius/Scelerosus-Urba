1. In terms of strongholds exploration in both ALC and in CCO lacks a variety of ways to make it look more like an labyrinth and to make it look
   more rewarding. That's why I will completely rewrite this game mechanic in terms of theoretical mechanisms and designs.

2. Tile setting:   ################# - 17 blocks wide, 17 blocks long
                   #               # - the more rewarding it's the more difficult stronghold you choose to raid
                   #               # - from 1-3 moving routes depending on the generation
                   #               # - possible secret entrances generation via ? sign events
                   #               # - possible multi-layered maps to make an exploration experience better
                   ################# - creative way to add bonus bosses and hidden vaults containing great rewards

3. Specific description: - Common hall - A simple tile with 2-4 enemies on norm. mode and 1-4 norm. chests and 0-2 ? icon interaction points
                         - Staircase hall - A tile with 3-5 enemies on normal mode and 1-3 normal chests and 0-3 ?, can lead into another story
                         - Boss chamber - A tile with 4-6 enemies on norm. mode with addition of a Boss itself. Has 2-6 norm. chests
                                          +1 guaranteed special chest. Only has an entrance back to where you came from, no ? points
                         - Vault room - A tile only accesible from the outside via decription key. It has no enemies there and 5-7 special chests
      Secret quarters: - A group of tiles accesible via ? points, those quarters have only special chests and there is a guaranteed vault room.
                         - Common secret hall - 3-5 enem. 3-5 special chests, 0-2 ? points which can't lead into another secret quarters. 
                         - Secret Bosses chamber - only 3 Bosses to defeat, 3-7 sp chests, no ? points, has an entrance to the vault
                         - Secret Vault - Same as a normal vault in terms of access, has 5-7 special chests
                   Stories: Depending on the gamemode you choose the stronghold will have 1-3 stories accessible via staircase hall.
                            The staircase will only bind 2 stories at the same time, so that there will be always a way to surprise players.

4. Game modes:
   - Normal: 1 story stronghold with 5% chance of finding another layer, enemies you encounter fight solo against you, bosses fight with
             a supporting enemy, secret quarters spawn in only 1% chance via ? points
