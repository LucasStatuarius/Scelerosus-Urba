1. In terms of strongholds exploration in both ALC and in CCO lacks a variety of ways to make it look more like an labyrinth and to make it look
   more rewarding. That's why I will completely rewrite this game mechanic in terms of theoretical mechanisms and designs.

2. Tile setting:   ################# - 17 blocks wide, 17 blocks long
                   #               # - the more challenging it's the more difficult stronghold you choose to raid
                   #               # - from 1-3 moving routes depending on the generation
                   #               # - possible secret entrances generation via ? sign events
                   #               # - possible multi-layered maps to make an exploration experience better
                   ################# - creative way to add bonus bosses and hidden vaults containing great rewards

3. Specific description: - Common hall - A simple tile with 2-4 enemies on norm. mode and 1-3 norm. chests and 0-2 ? icon interaction points
                         - Staircase hall - A tile with 3-5 enemies on normal mode and 1-2 normal chests and 0-3 ?, can lead into another story
                         - Boss chamber - A tile with 4-6 enemies on norm. mode with addition of a Boss itself. Has 1-5 norm. chests
                                          +1 guaranteed special chest. Only has an entrance back to where you came from
                         - Vault room - A tile only accesible via decription key

4. Game modes:
   - Normal: Always a 1 story map with a chance to find 1 hidden entrance and 1 vault room
